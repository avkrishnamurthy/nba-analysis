# NBA Data Analysis
This is a sports analytics project that aims to use data science to better understand the NBA, and how to optimize playstyle. As a huge sports enthusiast, this project combined my passion for software with sports. The first part of the project was to understand how the NBA's style of play has changed over the course of its history. The next part of the project aimed at evaluating if playstyles with large volumes of 3 point shots are associated with more winning teams. Both of these questions were answered with data visualization and statistical analysis tools.

## How it works
This project is built in Python Jupyter Notebook. It uses Pandas for data manipulation and web scraping to get data for NBA team stats over several decades. The project uses the Matplotlib package for visualization, to chart a heatmap of the shot distribution of all NBA shots over different years, with (x, y) shot location data. The scipy package is utilized to bolster the trends observed in the visualizations, by using t-tests and confidence intervals to determine that winning teams in the NBA shoot more threes than losing teams.
